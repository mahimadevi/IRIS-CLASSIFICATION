# IRIS-CLASSIFICATION
**Trained a model to distinguish between different species of the Iris flower based on four measurements: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.**

<h1> Requirements </h1>
1) NumPy <br/>
2) Pandas <br/>
3) Matplotlib <br/>
4) seaborn <br/>
5) sklearn <br/>
<br/>
First we calculated this model's accuracy mannually which is 86.61% then we again calculated it by ussing logic regression and cross validation. <br/>

<b>The final Accuracy of the model is: 98.18%<b/>
